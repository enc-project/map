Further develop character arcs: While the main characters are well-defined, their emotional journeys could be more detailed, especially for Akira and ARIA.

Expand on the antagonistic forces: The opposition from governments and corporations could be more specific and personified to create stronger conflict.

Clarify the science: Some of the futuristic concepts (like fusion energy and AI capabilities) might benefit from more grounding in current scientific understanding.

Tighten the pacing: The third act feels a bit rushed compared to the first two. Consider expanding on the challenges faced during the implementation of the "Future-Proof" plan.

Add more specific scenes showcasing the new economic system in action.

Incorporate more of the quotes and references mentioned in the story bible into the screenplay dialogue.

Consider adding a subplot or B-story to add depth to the narrative.

Proofread for consistency in character names and terminology throughout the script.
