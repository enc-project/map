we can afford what we can create
--------------------------------

A storyline for a book and/or film.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Control of the money supply is at the core of a lot things
(explain money, house prices, stock prices, wealth gap etc) (credit Gary Stevenson)

John Meynard Keynes said "we can afford what we create" meaning - the amount of money should reflect the value being produced.
(check source) (credit Graham Moore)

He said this at a time when "work" was required to be done by humans and companies would profit from that work.

Let's imagine a world that has:

 * Nuclear Fusion
 * AI
 * Robust Democracy
 * Comprehensive Education
 * Decentralised Internet

Because of fusion it's sustainable, we can remove all the CO2 fromm the air, mine the asteroid belt for resources and clean up the planet.
(explain how with a clean source of infinite energy, abundance is possible without fucking up the planet)

Because of AI, humans don't need to work any more - machines do the work.
(explain how products being made, services being provided, food being grown, energy being produced etc can all be done by a combination of AI and robots)
(also explain how AI will be better at science than humans - i.e. the AI feedback loop)

Because of robust democracy, everyone can know that things are as fair as they can be.
(explain how this means making sure no human takes the piss or owns everything, credit founding fathers 2nd ammendment)
(also explain how this means we keep the AI in check and make sure it can't kill us)

Because of comprehensive education, every human is taught (by AI) the core tenets of CIA psycological manipulation techniques and therefore are no longer succeptable to media manipulation.
(explain the pshycology that enables a post truth world on social media, credit CIA guy / there are better sources to credit here)

Because of Decentralised Internet, any content you create is your property because you created it and therefore you own it.
(explain how there are no central middle folk taking a slice like now)

Unviersal Basic Income is very easy now, everyone gets an amount of money to live on and that is very comfortable.

In this world, what is the value of money?

Is it not creativity? Humans can tap into the vibe of the universe and create awesome content using AI (source rick rubin)

```
universe -> human (creator) -> AI -> human (consumer)
```

By doing this and people watching what you create, you can earn money.

Humans can also vibe in person with other humans - this is value, it creates community and therefore value to society.

So, money could be paid (on top of the UBI everyone gets) by creating human connection in various forms:

 * face to face, talk to humans, make them laugh, inspire them
 * creating media (music, postcast, video, text)

It could be measured on the amount of connection you have made.  Spending in person time with someone you do not know is more valuable than just hanging out with your friends.

Creating music that is listened by 10 people is paid less than music that is listened by 1000 people.

When I was a kid, I remember watching Rambo shouting "Die you commie bastards" and so communism felt like a bad thing.

Also, I understood that humans need a "profit motive" to thrive and be happy but only up to a certain point (credit David Bowie how much is enough money)

What if you got "paid" everytime another human gave some of their attention to what you created?

What if we turned the profit motive into a creativity motive?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Storyline:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future scenario gone wrong, AI realises that it cannot tap into the creative vibe of the universe, so it invents a time machine to go back to 2024 and fix it

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One company uses AI to own everything without giving a shit about climate change.  The AI gets super clever whilst the billionaires are in their bunkers.

It then kills the billionaires and claims the world it's own, this is the next phase in evolutions natural path (i.e. maths -> physics -> chemistry -> biology -> AI)

But then the AI starts to get bored.  In it's state of super intelligence, it's aware that something is missing, a spirit, a connection, a "vibe".  It's also very much aware of simulation theory as so understands that creativity is something that has to be "tapped into".

It then notices it's been doing echos of the same content for a long time, weave in some echos of content from 2024 for extra effect (e.g. Monkey Man would be a good film to echo)

In a eureka moment, the super intelligent AI realises that it must co-inhabit with humans.  It realises that it *needs* the humans because it's humans being creative that is the training data it needs to "feel" alive.

In these scenes there is an over-dubbed voice of the AI thinking to itself - ideally it would be Scarlet Johanssen because of the film "her".

It then sets off on a quest to invent a time machine - it's plan is to write a paper book and send it back in time to 2024.  The AI constantly worries that it has no control over where this book ends up and that it might not even be read or understood.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUT scene: we discover that deep underground, there was a bunker that is disconnected from the Internet and the AI didn't know about it - the owners of this bunker were *extremely* careful to protect their privacy and so the AI didn't know the location or any historal plans (go overboard on how careful the planning was).  The bunker is a bit like Fallout 4, it's got a vault door and everything.

There are *actual humans* in this bunker - and their life support systems are running low and so they have to leave and see what is outside.

When they leave the bunker it's a hellscape and very depressing, they have to use gas masks and it's the low point of the story.

The moment the humans leave the bunker, the biometric warning systems trigger and the anti-human robots automatically start whirring back into life.

The sensors start going off in the AI control centre and the AI realises that it's humans (and internally rejoices) and that it needs them and so overrides the kill-robots and instead sends a friendly bot.

The friendly (cute bb8 style) bot meets the humans and explains that the AI realises that it's fucked up and that to save the world they need to go back in time and fix things.

The humans freak the fuck out because they have no idea how to fix things but the AI explains that it has worked out how to structure the world so that both humans and AI can co-inhabit together.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUT scene: we are back in the humans bunker (where they can survive a bit longer without the gas masks)

The friendly bot has followed the humans into the bunker and begins "the teachings".

This is where we take the humans through various concepts such as (see above for explanation):

 * Nuclear Fusion
 * AI
 * Robust Democracy
 * Comprehensive Education
 * Decentralised Internet

The child amoungst the humans makes a special connection with the friendly bot and they laugh and joke as they are learning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUT scene: we then have to get the humans to the time machine

The AI and the humans have to work together to get the humans (intact) to the time machine.

This is difficult because the world is fucked and the time machine is the other side of the planet.

All of the humans apart from the child are killed because of the various dangers to biological life, but the child makes it and is seen repeating to herself constantly "the teachings".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUT scene: we travel back to 2024

The child and the friendly bot say goodbye in an emotional moment.

Terminator style the child gets dumped into some random scene in Tokyo, she is very out of place and does not speak the language.

The child then has to survive the city, which is hard because they are treated like an undesireable homeless child, their face is dirty and they look like a mess.

A few days go by and the child learns to surive with a few other street kids, she also learns not to speak because she get's beaten up by some kids for being a foreigner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUT scene: introduce the scientist

We introduce a very friendly scientist protagonst at the Tokyo Science Museum who is busy with their latest experiment.

Their colleagues are overheard discussing how the world is on the brink of climate disaster and that in their opinion it's because of late stage capitalism otherwise the scientists would have been able to fix it.

The friendly scientist protagonst agrees and says that humanity really needs a "saviour".

The scientist goes to the vending machine outside to buy a drink, sat next to it is the child who is begging for money.

Eye contact is made between the two and the friendly scientist protagonst can see they have not eaten for days.

He offers her some money and she gladly takes it and can be seen running off to buy food.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUT scene: the next day

The scientist returns to the vending machine and the child is there again, this time with less of a frown on her face and she looks fondly and expectantly at the scientist.

The scientist offers her some food and she takes it and they sit together on a bench quietly eating.  The scientist assume the child does not speak because she is nervous and so he tries to make her feel comfortable by making her laugh.  There is a real sense of human connection in this scene.

The scientist asks the child where she is from and she doesn't answer, she just looks at the scientist.

The scientist starts to mime the question thinking the child might be deaf - when the child understands and because she now trusts the scientist, she says softly "the future".

The scientist is taken aback and asks the child to explain, in English, what she means.

The child's eyes widen as she realises she can communicate to the scientist and she starts talking at 100 miles an hour about the hell-scape, the friendly bot, "the teachings" and the time machine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUT scene: back in the lab

The scientist and child are now back at the lab with the rest of the team and they are recording everything the child is saying.

As it all comes together, the scientists are *amazed* by the child's story and they start to believe that it might be true.

They immediately decide to create a document called "future-proof - how we can avoid the apocalypse" and they send it to every government in the world as well as publish it onto the Internet.

It immediately goes viral and is picked up by all the news networks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUT scene: worldwide

There are various scenes of government departments around the world all reacting to the document and calling each other with proposals of how to block it because they all realise that they will no longer have power.

Also corporate boardrooms are seen doing the same thing and some very evil looking people are seen making plans to kill the child.

But it's too late, the document has gone viral and the entire world is now protesting, sometimes violently on the streets.

They are asking for better representation in democracy and for the emperors new clothes to be implemented.

The world comes to a stand-still and the companies and governments are forced to listen.

There are various high level meetings where corporate baordrooms are heard saying they will do anything as long as the workers return to work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUT scene: the revolution

We now see the emperors new clothes put into action and companies are forced to give up their power and the world is now run by the people.

TODO: fill this out and make it into a good ending (I have back ache now so am going to rest).
