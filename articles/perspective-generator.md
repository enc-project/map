## perspective generator

Social media alogrithms, in a quest to maximise engagement, have got very good at showing you things that you agree with, and hiding the things that you don't.

This polarises debate because each side becomes a radical version of itself.

Now we have large language models, we might feed an issue through what we could call a "perspective generator".

**DEMO**

It's job is not to try to persuade you to change your mind, but to remind you that other people have different perspectives.

Do you think this tool would be useful in politics?
