## political parties

Elections have become personality contests.  We are voting for people, not solutions.

We are forced to reduce our complex political views into a single colour; voting red, blue, green or yellow and then hoping that people do what they said they would do.

**ANIMATION OF VOTES TO TOP**

We have leaders who are not experts in the field they are making decisions in, the last time the minister for education set foot in a school was age 16.

We could have a system where the "minister for education" was a group of 1000 teachers and experts in that field.

It would still be a representative democracy, non experts in education could still vote for an expert to represent them.

Using the [perspective generator](perspective-generator.md), it would be easy to see which experts support which views on policy.

When decisions are made regarding education, the 1000 experts would vote on the decision.

**ANIMATION OF VOTES ACROSS TOPICS**

As a software engineers, we learn that when building complex systems, it's important to break the problem down into smaller problems and then re-build the solution from those smaller parts.

Trying to build a single machine, all in one go, that will solve all the problems simply does not work.

Should we challenge the idea of voting for a political party and instead vote for a group of experts in each field?
