## the election cycle takes ages

Back in the Bronze age of computers - we used to release software on CD's, which inevitably had bugs - small errors that result from an oversight of the programmer.  We would put up with the bugs in our software until a new CD (or cassette tape) would be released like 6 months later.

It was not an efficient system.

Now we have the Internet, these days Amazon releases new code and bug fixes more than [one hundred thousand times per day](https://iq.opengenus.org/companies-have-high-deployment-rate/).  This is possible because of a thing called continous integration, which puts a focus on tests to make sure that when a problem is discovered, a fix can be applied quickly and that fix has not actually made things worse.

This means when things are not working, or could be done more efficiently, they can be changed, quickly.

It's important that this is done using a data and test driven approach.  Each time a change is proposed, we must propose how that change will be tested and by what metric we will call it a success.

In politics, we put our faith in people to make the right decisions.  If we notice that they are doing a bad job, we have to wait 5 years to vote them out and fix the bug.

Could we design a system which lets us collectively decide on a course of action on a single issue (see [political parties](political-parties.md))?

Rather than wait for an election cycle and then hope the new person makes good decisions, we could be constantly testing and iterating on the decisions we make as a population.

The technology to do this is now available, do you think it can help politics?
