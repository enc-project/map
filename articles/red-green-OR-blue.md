## red, green OR blue

Elections have become personality contests.  We are voting for people, not solutions.

We are forced to reduce our complex political views into a single colour; voting red, green OR blue and then hoping that people do what they said they would do (lol).

**ANIMATION OF VOTES TO TOP**

We have leaders who are not experts in the field they are making decisions in, the last time the minister for education set foot in a school was age 16.

We could have a system where the "minister for education" was a group of 1000 teachers and experts in that field.

It would still be a representative democracy, non experts in education could still vote for an expert to represent them.

Using the [perspective generator](perspective-generator.md), it would be easy to see which experts support which views on policy.

When decisions are made regarding education, the 1000 experts would vote on the decision.

**ANIMATION OF VOTES ACROSS TOPICS**

As a software engineers, we learn that when building complex systems, it's important to break the problem down into smaller problems and then re-build the solution from those smaller parts.

Trying to build a single machine, all in one go, that will solve all the problems simply does not work.

Should we challenge the idea of voting for a political party and instead vote for a group of experts in each field?

Which parts of policy making should not be done this way? (e.g. foreign relations, MI6 etc)

Is the current system of voting for one person to make ALL the decisions working?
