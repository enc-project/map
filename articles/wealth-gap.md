That is because, the rich will buy assets with their money, which is why house prices and stock prices go up and everyone thinks the economy is doing well.

When the government prints money (like they have done to pay for Covid), it ends up in the hands of rich people, who buy assets with it.  As they do this, the price of shares and houses (i.e. assets) goes up.
