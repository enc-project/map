This is a call to action, how will we be seen by our great grand children?

If we just accept that the current approach to politics cannot be changed - the answer is we are fucked.  Down that path, we won't have any great grand children.

We must question the very ground we walk on and start reform **immediately**.

The biggest challenges to ever face humanity are already here and yet we are busy arguing over the scraps left behind by the billionaires who have already built their bunkers.

Humans are an amazingly inventive and resourceful species, let's start using these inventions of ours to co-ordinate ourselves.

The current political system, that is obviously failing, was invented **before electricity**.

Let's leave our great grand children a world.

## composition over inheritance

When building complex systems, it's important to break the problem down into smaller problems and then re-build the solution from those smaller parts.

Trying to build a single machine, all in one go, that will solve all the problems simply does not work.

We learnt this in software - we have a thing called "object orientated programming" and it basically means:

> design a thing and then "inherit" from that thing when nuance happens

Imagine if I said to you I've invented a really useful widget called the "maxotron-2000" - it can cut things, screw things, hammer things and do all sorts of other useful tasks.

There would be some slick marketing campaign that makes this machine look amazing - all shiny and capable of removing stress from your life and solving your problems.

Then life happens - chaos, shit breaks, people don't do what they said they would do or they do it wrong.  It turns out that the "maxotron-2000" does not have the capability to adjust to reality but because we've already sold ourselves on the idea it should, we pretend it can still work and fudge our way through.

It turns out that it's much better to **compose** a solution from lots of smaller parts.  Have a hammer, a saw, a chisel and some nails and then when problems crop up - let's pick which tool we need to use to solve each problem.

Electing a single government who will make **all** decisions is like the "maxotron-2000" - it means well but fails to deal with the complexity of modern life.

Things to expand upon:

 * the fact we are voting for people not solutions
 * an individual has a complex political view which is composed of lots of different perspectives across different topics
   * we are forced to reduce this to "red or blue"
 * it should always be experts in the field that are making decisions in that field
 * political parties are the problem
 * we can still have a representative democracy - but you vote for the "rivers and wildlife" MP rather than the "tory or labour" MP
   * if people can't be fucked to care - that is totally fine, enough people will care about each subject
 * media manipulation
   * it's much harder to manipulate someone's political view if you have to change their mind on 2000 different topics
   * at the moment "look at this knob eating a bacon sandwich" can swing an election
   * that would be much harder if politics was "composed" of many smaller parts

## continuous integration

Back in the Bronze age of computers - we used to release software on CD's (and in the Iron age on cassette tapes).

Software inevitably has bugs - small errors that result from an oversight of the programmer.  This is normal and to be expected.  Humans are not perfect and to expect them to be is a problem (hey Instagram - wtf).

Back in the day - we would put up with the bugs in our software until a new CD (or cassette tape) would be released like 6 months later.

It was not an efficient system.

These days - Amazon release code into production **12 thousand** times per day (and that was in 2015).  This is possible because of continous integration, which puts a focus on tests to make sure that when a problem is discovered, a fix can be applied quickly and that fix has not actually made things worse.

This is not rocket science - it's how modern software works - ask anyone.

Our approach to governments is positively prehistoric.  We elect a government and it inevitably comes with bugs.  This is OK - as we said, humans are not perfect.  What is annoying is we have to wait **5 years** before fixing those bugs.

Why are we not taking a data driven, tested approach to government policy?

Things to expand upon:

 * a "manifesto" should not be "we will do this" - it should be "this is how we will test this"
 * there should be constant testing and looking at the data
 * the civil service (ONS etc) would do a wonderful job of this
 * we should be able to react quickly to data showing that something is wrong

## proxy MP's

If we are to make **actual** change (and for this not just to be another protest that is ignored) - we will need a political revolution.

Those are normally not very nice and people get hurt because it normally involves some kind of violence.

We need a plan for how we can change how things are **without** having to storm the house of commons.

A proxy MP is one that stands in the election just like normal - it would cost something like £350,000 to do this in the UK (i.e. putting up the £500 deposit for an MP in each constituency).  The key thing is that each MP makes it very clear that they are not actually going to make any decisions but instead defer to the platform.

Things to expand upon:

 * yes, this is an actual political party we are starting
 * once a majority is held, the constitution can be changed
 * this is the same as any other political party, the difference is that the MP's are not making decisions

## other things

This is a list of other things we should cover - there are many more but for now here we are:

 * AI - large language models are a very useful tool to automate various parts of the platform
 * web3 - we have the technology to do this where we don't need to trust anyone
 * long term stock ownership
   * a lot of the current problems are because of shareholders
   * if you buy shares in a company and you cannot sell them for X years it would solve a lot of this
 * David bowie rich enough
 * we have no idea what we are doing
