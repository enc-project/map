This is a call to action, how will we be seen by our great grand children?

If we just accept that the current approach to politics cannot be changed - the answer is we are fucked.  Down that path, we won't have any great grand children.

The biggest challenges to face humanity are here and we are busy arguing over scraps left behind by billionaires who have already built their bunkers.

The current political system, that is obviously failing, was invented **before electricity** so we must question the very ground we walk on.

We are an amazingly inventive and resourceful species, let's start using these inventions of ours to co-ordinate ourselves.

## I have no idea what I'm doing

I can barely run my own day.  My life is a constant mess and I am what some people would call a "waste man".

If you hear me trying to say "I know how to run the country" - laugh in my face and move on.

At the same time, perhaps pinning our hopes on an individual (or group of individuals) to know how to run the country is part of our problem.

It becomes a personality contest, not a serious debate about how to solve the problems we face.

We still need leaders, people who will represent us internationally.  We should still vote for experts in their field to make decisions in that field.  We should still vote.

However, with the invention of first the Internet and now generative AI, we have the tools to do things differently, what does that look like is an interesting question.

The point of this project is not to say "look, we've solved it".  It's instead as the saying goes:

> to get the right answer on the Internet, first put the wrong answer

So, here are some wrong answers to get the conversation started:

 * [political parties are the problem](wrong-answers/political-parties.md)
 * [election cycles](wrong-answers/election-cycles.md)
 * [proxy mps](wrong-answers/proxy-mps.md)

## other things

This is a list of other things we should cover - there are many more but for now here we are:

 * AI - large language models are a very useful tool to automate various parts of the platform
 * web3 - we have the technology to do this where we don't need to trust anyone
 * long term stock ownership
   * a lot of the current problems are because of shareholders
   * if you buy shares in a company and you cannot sell them for X years it would solve a lot of this
 * David bowie rich enough
 * we have no idea what we are doing
