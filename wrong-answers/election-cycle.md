## election cycle

Back in the Bronze age of computers - we used to release software on CD's (and in the Iron age on cassette tapes).

Software inevitably has bugs - small errors that result from an oversight of the programmer.  This is normal and to be expected.  Humans are not perfect and to expect them to be is a problem (hey Instagram - wtf).

Back in the day - we would put up with the bugs in our software until a new CD (or cassette tape) would be released like 6 months later.

It was not an efficient system.

These days - Amazon release code into production **12 thousand** times per day (and that was in 2015).  This is possible because of continous integration, which puts a focus on tests to make sure that when a problem is discovered, a fix can be applied quickly and that fix has not actually made things worse.

This is not rocket science - it's how modern software works - ask anyone.

Our approach to governments is positively prehistoric.  We elect a government and it inevitably comes with bugs.  This is OK - as we said, humans are not perfect.  What is annoying is we have to wait **5 years** before fixing those bugs.

Why are we not taking a data driven, tested approach to government policy?

Things to expand upon:

 * a "manifesto" should not be "we will do this" - it should be "this is how we will test this"
 * there should be constant testing and looking at the data
 * the civil service (ONS etc) would do a wonderful job of this
 * we should be able to react quickly to data showing that something is wrong
