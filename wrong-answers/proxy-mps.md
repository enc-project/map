## proxy MP's

If we are to make **actual** change (and for this not just to be another protest that is ignored) - we will need a political revolution.

Those are normally not very nice and people get hurt because it normally involves some kind of violence.

We need a plan for how we can change how things are **without** having to storm the house of commons.

A proxy MP is one that stands in the election just like normal - it would cost something like £350,000 to do this in the UK (i.e. putting up the £500 deposit for an MP in each constituency).  The key thing is that each MP makes it very clear that they are not actually going to make any decisions but instead defer to the platform.

Things to expand upon:

 * yes, this is an actual political party we are starting
 * once a majority is held, the constitution can be changed
 * this is the same as any other political party, the difference is that the MP's are not making decisions
