## political parties

As a software engineer, we can have a thought experiment:

> what happens if we model the constitution like a software system?

When building complex systems, it's important to break the problem down into smaller problems and then re-build the solution from those smaller parts.

Trying to build a single machine, all in one go, that will solve all the problems simply does not work.

We learnt this in software - we have a thing called "object orientated programming" and it basically means:

> design a thing and then "inherit" from that thing when nuance happens

Imagine if I said to you I've invented a really useful widget called the "maxotron-2000" - it can cut things, screw things, hammer things and do all sorts of other useful tasks.

There would be some slick marketing campaign that makes this machine look amazing - all shiny and capable of removing stress from your life and solving your problems.

Then life happens - chaos, shit breaks, people don't do what they said they would do or they do it wrong.  It turns out that the "maxotron-2000" does not have the capability to adjust to reality but because we've already sold ourselves on the idea it should, we pretend it can still work and fudge our way through.

It turns out that it's much better to **compose** a solution from lots of smaller parts.  Have a hammer, a saw, a chisel and some nails and then when problems crop up - let's pick which tool we need to use to solve each problem.

Electing a single government who will make **all** decisions is like the "maxotron-2000" - it means well but fails to deal with the complexity of modern life.

Things to expand upon:

 * the fact we are voting for people not solutions
 * an individual has a complex political view which is composed of lots of different perspectives across different topics
   * we are forced to reduce this to "red or blue"
 * it should always be experts in the field that are making decisions in that field
 * political parties are the problem
 * we can still have a representative democracy - but you vote for the "rivers and wildlife" MP rather than the "tory or labour" MP
   * if people can't be fucked to care - that is totally fine, enough people will care about each subject
 * media manipulation
   * it's much harder to manipulate someone's political view if you have to change their mind on 2000 different topics
   * at the moment "look at this knob eating a bacon sandwich" can swing an election
   * that would be much harder if politics was "composed" of many smaller parts
