## share ownership

Here is a comment from a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/18gnp64/comment/kd2fgyc):

> You’ve explained in perfect detail why all public companies will inevitably “fail”.

> Fail being in quotations because it doesn’t always mean complete failure, but the business model itself is impossible to sustain.

> Continuous growth is the business model, because the bigger a company gets, the more investors it gains, and investors want to see a return on their investment, eventually leading to a need for every quarter having higher profits than the last, which is eventually inpossible.

> You see it time and time again, companies will start to cut quality, cut or overwork employees, raise prices beyond what they should be etc etc. this leads to a few different “failures” that either make it go tits up or if they’re too big to fail, lead to things like restructuring, merging with/acquiring other companies, stock splits to attract new investors etc.

> Point is instead of looking at the big picture, public companies look at it quarter by quarter. Where a private business would easily see that hiring more employees to increase the output and reduce over work would pay off tremendously in the long run when they release their game, public companies only see “if we hired 10 more employees Q3 would be slightly in the red, and shareholders can’t have that”

How do we solve this? Is it making people have to hold their shares for at least 5 years? Does the free market work for everything? Is this even a problem?
