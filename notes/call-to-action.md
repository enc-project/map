# call to action

This is a call to action, how will we be seen by our great grand children?

If we just accept that the current approach to politics cannot be changed - the answer is we are fucked.  Down that path, we won't have any great grand children.

The biggest challenges to face humanity are here and we are busy arguing over scraps left behind by billionaires who have already built their bunkers.

The current political system, that is obviously failing, was invented **before electricity** so we must question the very ground we walk on.

We are an amazingly inventive and resourceful species, let's start using these inventions of ours to co-ordinate ourselves.
