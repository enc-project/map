### stock markets suck

Stock markets are not good

```
You’ve explained in perfect detail why all public companies will inevitably “fail”.

Fail being in quotations because it doesn’t always mean complete failure, but the business model itself is impossible to sustain.

Continuous growth is the business model, because the bigger a company gets, the more investors it gains, and investors want to see a return on their investment, eventually leading to a need for every quarter having higher profits than the last, which is eventually inpossible.

You see it time and time again, companies will start to cut quality, cut or overwork employees, raise prices beyond what they should be etc etc. this leads to a few different “failures” that either make it go tits up or if they’re too big to fail, lead to things like restructuring, merging with/acquiring other companies, stock splits to attract new investors etc.

Point is instead of looking at the big picture, public companies look at it quarter by quarter. Where a private business would easily see that hiring more employees to increase the output and reduce over work would pay off tremendously in the long run when they release their game, public companies only see “if we hired 10 more employees Q3 would be slightly in the red, and shareholders can’t have that”

The prime minister should pay as much tax as possible because they have the most sway over how the tax is spent

### questioning the very ground we walk on

A single person, group of people, cohort or any other structure of people cannot make good decisions to maximise human potential (blanket phrase for making the most number of people at least comortable, if not happy)

We have the tech to change this.  The Internet.  Running fine-tuned LLMs at scale.

### money

Set the highest amount anyone "could" earn - it's the David Bowie rule - he appears in unlikely places.

X million per year or something what not.

Companies are the organisational unit that will be replaced by AI.

People can strive to "earn" by doing more or doing well.

People who choose not to or cannot work are paid the baseline which is as comfortable as possible with resources spread evenly.

Working earns on top but baseline is comfortable because no one is taking from the top because there are no companies any more because AI runs those.
