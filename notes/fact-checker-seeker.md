So often online you see something that appears to be bullshit, but it's quite hard to just go and find the data. For example I did go to the ONS for the muslims not in work link and I couldn't find the religion based data, but someone else did. You should be able to check something someone has stated, or find evidence for the point you are making. Obviously sometimes the data could prove both points of view, but when it is factually incorrect, it should be easier to get to the truth of the matter.
