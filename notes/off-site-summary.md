The human spirit - the essence - the vibe - 

the video that connor linked (the channel 5 guy who locks in spreadsheets and is the mr positivitiy for corporations)

that is the spirit - it's dope - but applied to non evil things

lock-in - create - build - grow - thrive - how can we do this where everyone who does something good gets a feeling of "I'm doing something good" - and they can see the results of their actions
